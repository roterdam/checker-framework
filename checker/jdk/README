This directory contains annotated versions of the JDK.

(Annotated versions of non-JDK libraries appear in stub files, such as
checker-framework/checker/src/org/checkerframework/checker/nullness/astubs/gnu-getopt.astub .)

See chapter "Annotating libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual for
information on using these classes.

Some generated .jar files are checked into the repository, because
generating them requires external dependencies (the Annotation File
Utilities) and because it prevents bugs related to different people using
different versions of the JDK.

If you need stub files for additional library classes -- in the JDK or another
library -- those can be generated using the StubGenerator tool along with some
manual annotating.  The "Annotating libraries" chapter of the manual describes
this process as well.

If you do create new stub files please share them with us via email at
checker-framework-dev@googlegroups.com.  Thanks!

Our policy is to only add fully-annotated classes to the JDK, to avoid
confusion that could result from some methods in a class being correctly
annotated and other methods not being annotated.  So, it is best if you can
provide a fully-annotated class (this requires examining all the methods in
the class).  Otherwise, provide what you can, but the annotations won't be
added to the Checker Framework distribution until someone else gets a
chance to examine all the other methods.
