This jar is a stand in for either source/javadoc for the annotations
used by the Checker Framework to type check source code.   The
checker-qual-compat.jar contains annotations that are compatible
with JDK 7 and previous, which do not support type annotations
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/type_annotations.html).
